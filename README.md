# Hang Man
The Hangman project in Python is a computer game that involves guessing a word by guessing individual letters.
The game starts with a blank word and a number of dashes equal to the length of the word. 
The player is then prompted to guess a letter, and if the letter is in the word, it is revealed in its proper place. 
If the letter is not in the word, the player loses a "life". 
The player continues guessing letters until either they have correctly guessed the word or they have used up all of their lives. 
I have used 10 lives for the game. **The game is over when the word is correctly guessed or all lives are lost.**
